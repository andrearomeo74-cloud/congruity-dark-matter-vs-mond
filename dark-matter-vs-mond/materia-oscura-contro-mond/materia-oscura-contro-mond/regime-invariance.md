# Regime Invariance

## Core Idea

The Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity dilemma can be reframed as a question of
**regime-dependent coherence** rather than competing ontologies.

Under a Congruity 7.0 perspective, different observational and inferential
regimes may yield different *effective descriptions* while respecting the same
underlying invariants.

The apparent conflict arises when a **single global inferential regime**
is incorrectly assumed across scales.

## Definition of Regime Invariance

A quantity, relation, or constraint is **regime-invariant** if it remains
consistent across different structural or inferential regimes, even when
the local descriptive variables change.

Regime invariance does **not** require identical equations or parameters,
but **consistent coherence boundaries**.

## Candidate Regime Invariants

Within the Dark Matter / MOND context, plausible invariants include:

- **Cross-scale coherence**  
  The system maintains predictive consistency across galactic, cluster,
  and cosmological scales.

- **Energy–Structure balance**  
  The ratio between dynamical demand (E) and structural support (S)
  remains bounded.

- **Inference closure constraint**  
  Compensatory terms appear only when informational closure (I)
  is insufficient for the imposed structural or energetic demands.

- **Predictive stability**  
  Successful regimes minimize ad-hoc corrections while preserving
  cross-regime predictability.

## Interpretation

From this perspective:

- Dark Matter acts as a **compensatory structural term** under regimes
  optimized for large-scale statistical closure.

- MOND-like modifications act as **local coherence corrections**
  under regimes with tighter kinematic constraints and limited inference depth.

Both can be locally optimal while respecting the same global invariants.

## Key Consequence

The dilemma is not resolved by choosing the “correct” entity or law,
but by identifying **which invariants must be preserved**
across regime transitions.

A failure to respect regime invariance leads to artificial tensions,
misinterpreted as ontological conflicts.

## Scope Note

This document proposes **conceptual invariants** only.
No claim is made of new physical constants or finalized laws.

Empirical validation and formal modeling are required to test
whether the proposed invariants hold in observational data.
