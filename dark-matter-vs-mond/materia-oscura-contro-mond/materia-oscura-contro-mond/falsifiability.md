## Falsifiability of the Regime-Based Framework

This framework does not propose new physical entities, laws, or numerical predictions.
Its validity depends on whether regime-dependent coherence is necessary to explain
persistent discrepancies between observational domains.

The framework would be falsified under any of the following conditions:

### F1 — Cross-regime convergence
If a single dynamical description accounts consistently for all relevant observations
across scales and regimes without invoking regime-specific inference structures,
the regime-based explanation becomes unnecessary.

### F2 — Direct ontological invariant
If a directly observable quantity is identified that is invariant across regimes
and uniquely discriminates between dark matter and modified gravity explanations,
the framework loses explanatory relevance.

### F3 — Neutral regime transformation
If observations from different regimes can be transformed into one another
without structural information loss, and without introducing regime-specific closure,
the discrepancy is not regime-dependent.

Until such conditions are met, the framework remains a valid diagnostic lens
for interpreting persistent theoretical tensions.
