# Regime Invariance (Conceptual)

## Motivation

A central source of confusion in the Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity debate
is the implicit assumption that a **single global inferential regime**
must hold across all scales, environments, and observational constraints.

Within a Congruity-based framework, this assumption is relaxed.

Instead, coherence is evaluated **within regimes**, and meaningful
theoretical progress requires identifying what remains invariant
*across* regimes.

This motivates the concept of **regime invariance**.

## Definition

A quantity, relation, or structural constraint is said to be **regime-invariant**
if it remains stable across changes in the inferential or structural regime,
even when compensatory modeling terms differ.

Formally (conceptual):

- Let \( R_i \) denote an inference regime
  (defined by scale, data density, closure assumptions, and dynamics).
- Let \( M_i \) be the model used under \( R_i \).
- Let \( O \) be a class of observables.

A regime invariant is a property \( I \) such that:

- \( I(O, M_i) \approx I(O, M_j) \)
- for all admissible regimes \( R_i, R_j \)
- up to bounded informational and structural tolerances.

## Role in the Congruity Framework

Recall the minimal conceptual coherence score:

\[
C := \frac{V}{E + I + S}
\]

where:

- **E** — energetic / dynamical demands,
- **I** — information closure,
- **S** — structure and scale coupling,
- **V** — functional or predictive value.

Regime invariance does **not** require that E, I, or S be identical
across regimes.

Instead, it requires that:

- violations or adjustments in one domain are **compensated**
  without breaking invariant relations that preserve V.

Dark Matter terms and Modified Gravity laws can be interpreted as
**different compensatory insertions** required to preserve
regime-invariant coherence when E/S demands exceed I-supported closure.

---

## Examples (Conceptual)

Examples of candidate regime-invariant structures include:

- Scaling relations that persist across galaxies with different baryonic profiles.
- Conservation constraints that hold despite different dynamical parameterizations.
- Predictive regularities that remain stable under alternative closure assumptions.

Crucially, these invariants are **not** tied to a specific ontology
(matter vs law), but to structural coherence.

---

## Implications for the Dark Matter vs MOND Debate

From a regime-invariant perspective:

- Dark Matter and MOND-like models are not mutually exclusive competitors,
  but **local maxima of coherence** under different regimes.
- The apparent tension arises when one attempts to enforce a single
  inferential regime globally.
- Empirical success should be evaluated by **invariant preservation**,
  not by adherence to a preferred explanatory primitive.

This reframes the debate from *what exists* to *what must remain coherent*.

## Limits and Scope

This document is:

- purely theoretical and conceptual,
- non-operational,
- non-quantitative,
- not a proposal of new physical constants or laws.

Empirical validation, numerical modeling, and falsification criteria
are addressed separately.

---

## Summary

Regime invariance provides a structural criterion for coherence
across heterogeneous inferential contexts.

It allows apparently competing cosmological explanations
to be understood as regime-specific realizations
of deeper, invariant constraints.

This shift transforms the Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity dilemma
from a binary choice into a structured coherence problem.
