# Falsifiability Within a Regime-Based Congruity Framework

## Scope

This document outlines how the Congruity 7.0 regime-based formulation can be
considered *falsifiable* at a conceptual and structural level, without
introducing new physical constants, executable models, or parameter fitting.

The goal is not to falsify Dark Matter or Modified Gravity as physical entities,
but to test whether a given explanation remains *coherent* within a specified
inferential and structural regime.

## What Is Being Tested (and What Is Not)

### Tested
- Internal coherence of an explanatory regime
- Consistency across scale transitions
- Closure between energetic demands (E), informational support (I),
  and structural assumptions (S)
- Stability of functional value (V) across regimes

### Not Tested
- Existence of Dark Matter as a particle
- Validity of General Relativity or MOND as fundamental laws
- Numerical parameter fits to observational datasets
- Predictive accuracy of specific cosmological models

## Regime-Based Falsifiability Principle

A regime is considered *conceptually falsified* if one or more of the following
conditions hold:

1. **Information Deficit**
   - The explanatory regime requires energetic or structural terms that exceed
     the information closure supported by observations.
   - Formally:  
     E + S demand ≫ I-supported closure

2. **Cross-Regime Instability**
   - An explanation that works at one scale fails to preserve coherence when
     transferred to another scale without introducing ad-hoc compensations.

3. **Structural Overloading**
   - Additional terms are repeatedly introduced not as predictions, but as
     compensatory artifacts required to preserve consistency.

4. **Loss of Functional Value**
   - Predictive or explanatory value (V) decreases when additional complexity
     is added, indicating incoherent scaling.

## Interpretation for Dark Matter vs MOND

Within this framework:

- **Dark Matter** and **MOND-like modifications** are interpreted as
  *regime-dependent compensatory mechanisms*, not mutually exclusive truths.

- Each approach may represent a *local maximum of coherence* under specific
  informational and structural constraints.

- Apparent falsification arises when a single regime is assumed to be globally
  valid across all scales without sufficient informational support.

## Key Implication

Falsifiability shifts from:
> “Is this entity real?”

to:
> “Is this explanation coherent under the assumed regime, scale, and
> informational closure?”

This reframing preserves scientific rigor while avoiding false dichotomies
between competing explanatory frameworks.

## Bounded falsification signal (conceptual)

Within a regime-based congruity perspective, a potential falsification signal does not arise from the failure of a specific entity (e.g. dark matter particles) or law modification, but from the breakdown of proportional compensation.

Conceptually, a coherence breakdown would be indicated if an observational regime were identified where:

- energetic and/or structural demands (E/S) exceed informational closure (I),
- no compensatory strategy (mass addition, law modification, or closure shift) restores stability of functional value (V),
- and additional complexity systematically reduces explanatory or predictive value.

Such a case would not falsify a specific theory, but would signal the emergence of a new inferential regime outside the closure domain of both dark matter–like and MOND-like strategies.
## Status

This document is:
- Theoretical
- Non-operational
- Non-empirical

It provides a falsifiability *language*, not a falsification *experiment*.

Empirical validation remains the responsibility of domain-specific models and
observations.
