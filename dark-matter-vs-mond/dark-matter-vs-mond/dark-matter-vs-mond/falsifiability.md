# Falsifiability (Conceptual)

## Purpose

This document defines **conceptual falsifiability criteria** for the
regime-based Congruity framework applied to the
Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity dilemma.

Falsifiability here does **not** refer to a single decisive experiment,
but to structured conditions under which the framework would lose
explanatory coherence.

---

## What Is Being Tested

The framework makes a precise *theoretical* claim:

> The apparent Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity dilemma arises from enforcing
> a single global inferential regime across heterogeneous observational contexts.

This claim is falsified if regime-based coherence fails to explain
empirical regularities without introducing additional contradictions.

---

## Falsification Criteria (Conceptual)

The regime-based congruity framework would be falsified if **any** of the
following conditions were met.

### 1. Regime-Independence of a Single Model

If a single model (e.g. ΛCDM or a MOND-like law):

- remains fully coherent,
- preserves predictive value,
- and requires no compensatory terms

**across all scales, environments, and data-density regimes**,  

then the introduction of regime dependence becomes unnecessary.

This would invalidate the core motivation of the framework.

---

### 2. Breakdown of Invariant Preservation

If regime transitions necessarily produce:

- irreducible contradictions,
- loss of predictive stability,
- or violations of proposed invariant relations,

then the assumption that coherence can be preserved across regimes
is false.

In this case, regime invariance would be empirically unsupported.

---

### 3. Arbitrary Compensation Requirement

If compensatory terms (e.g. dark matter components or modified force laws):

- cannot be systematically related to E / I / S imbalances,
- or must be introduced ad hoc without structural justification,

then the Congruity formulation loses explanatory power.

A framework that permits arbitrary compensation is non-falsifiable
and therefore invalid.

---

### 4. Predictive Inferiority Across Regimes

If, for comparable levels of model complexity:

- regime-based explanations consistently underperform
  single-regime theories in predictive accuracy,
- or fail to unify observational domains,

then the framework provides no scientific advantage
and should be rejected.

---

## What Would Not Falsify the Framework

The following outcomes do **not** constitute falsification:

- Continued empirical success of ΛCDM in large-scale cosmology.
- Continued empirical success of MOND-like relations at galactic scales.
- Coexistence of multiple effective theories across regimes.
- Discovery that regime boundaries shift with improved data.

These outcomes are *expected* under a regime-based interpretation.

---

## Testability Without Operationalization

Although this framework is non-operational, it is testable via:

- comparative coherence analysis,
- cross-regime consistency checks,
- identification of invariant-preserving vs invariant-breaking transitions.

Operational models may be developed in the future,
but falsifiability does not depend on immediate quantification.

---

## Scope and Limits

This document:

- does not propose experiments,
- does not specify thresholds or numerical criteria,
- does not claim empirical verification.

It provides a **logical falsification map** for evaluating
whether regime-based congruity is a meaningful explanatory structure.

---

## Summary

The Congruity regime-based framework is falsifiable if:

- regime dependence is unnecessary,
- invariants fail to hold,
- compensation becomes arbitrary,
- or predictive coherence degrades.

Absent these failures, it remains a viable theoretical lens
for reframing the Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity problem.
