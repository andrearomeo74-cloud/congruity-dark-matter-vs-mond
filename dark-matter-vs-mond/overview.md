# Overview

This document outlines the Dark Matter vs MOND dilemma as a regime-based coherence problem.

The apparent conflict is not between matter and gravity,
but between different inferential closures operating under distinct structural regimes.

This file provides the conceptual map used by the rest of the repository.
## Regime map (conceptual)

| Regime / scale | Primary closure move | What is compensated | Congruity reading (informal) | Typical observational anchors (examples) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Galactic (low-acceleration) | MOND-like modification (I) | Inference rule / law under low a | Change the rule to preserve coherence in the low-a regime | Flat rotation curves; baryonic Tully–Fisher relation |
| Cluster / cosmological | Dark matter–like addition (E/S) | Missing gravitating mass / structure | Add hidden mass/structure to preserve coherence at large scales | Cluster lensing (e.g. Bullet Cluster); CMB power spectrum |
