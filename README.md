# Congruity 7.0 — Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity (Regime-Based Formalization)

This repository is a **theoretical** Congruity 7.0 extension applied to the long-standing cosmology dilemma:
**Dark Matter (ΛCDM) vs Modified Gravity (MOND-like)**.
## Scope and intent

This repository presents a **theoretical, non-operational framework** for reframing
the Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity dilemma as a **regime-dependent coherence problem**.

This repository is intentionally conceptual and structurally complete. See individual documents for scope and limitations.
It does **not** propose new physical constants, parameter fits, or executable models.

All formulations are conceptual and intended to clarify inference structure,
not to replace or extend existing cosmological theories.

Dark Matter (ΛCDM) and MOND-like approaches are treated as **local maxima of coherence**
under different structural and inferential regimes.
Core claim (theoretical):
> The “tension” is not primarily a dispute about entities (matter) vs laws (gravity),
> but about **regime-dependent coherence** under bounded information and structural coupling.

We model coherence across four domains:
- **E** — Energy / dynamics (orbital velocities, potentials, kinetic constraints)
- **I** — Information (observational tracers, sampling, inference closure)
- **S** — Structure (scale, coupling, distributions, hierarchy)
- **V** — Functional value (predictive stability, cross-regime consistency)

## Minimal congruity frame
We use a minimal conceptual score:
\[
C \;=\; \frac{V}{E + I + S}
\]
Interpretation (conceptual):
- coherence fails when **E/S demand** exceeds **I-supported closure**,
- and a compensatory term appears (called “dark matter” or “modified gravity” depending on where it is inserted).

## What this repo is (and is not)
✅ A theoretical, regime-based formalization and language for reframing the debate  
✅ Markdown-only: definitions, minimal models, invariance proposals, testable predictions (conceptual)  
❌ Not medical/financial advice (N/A), not engineering instructions, not executable criteria  
❌ No optimization targets, thresholds, or operational decision rules  
❌ No claim of new physical constants; requires empirical validation and peer review

## Regime framing (why “DM vs MOND” is often the wrong question)

This repository does **not** propose a new gravity theory, nor does it attempt to “pick a winner” between Dark Matter and MOND.

Instead, it frames the tension as a **regime + admissibility** problem:

- **Dark Matter–like explanations** tend to be congruent when the observed dynamics require additional degrees of freedom across large scales, where structure formation, lensing, and multi-system closure dominate.
- **MOND-like explanations** tend to be congruent in specific low-acceleration regimes where local dynamical regularities compress the description and reduce model complexity.

In Congruity terms, these approaches can be understood as **different closures under different constraints** (scale, density, information, and observational coupling).  
What looks like a contradiction may be a sign that we are forcing a single explanatory grammar onto multiple physical regimes.

**Key claim (framework-level):** the core question is not “DM or MOND?”, but  
**which modeling grammar remains admissible under the constraints of the regime being measured.**
