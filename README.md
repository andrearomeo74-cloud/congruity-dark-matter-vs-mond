# Congruity 7.0 — Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity (Regime-Based Formalization)

This repository is a **theoretical** Congruity 7.0 extension applied to the long-standing cosmology dilemma:
**Dark Matter (ΛCDM) vs Modified Gravity (MOND-like)**.

Core claim (theoretical):
> The “tension” is not primarily a dispute about entities (matter) vs laws (gravity),
> but about **regime-dependent coherence** under bounded information and structural coupling.

We model coherence across four domains:
- **E** — Energy / dynamics (orbital velocities, potentials, kinetic constraints)
- **I** — Information (observational tracers, sampling, inference closure)
- **S** — Structure (scale, coupling, distributions, hierarchy)
- **V** — Functional value (predictive stability, cross-regime consistency)

## Minimal congruity frame
We use a minimal conceptual score:
\[
C \;=\; \frac{V}{E + I + S}
\]
Interpretation (conceptual):
- coherence fails when **E/S demand** exceeds **I-supported closure**,
- and a compensatory term appears (called “dark matter” or “modified gravity” depending on where it is inserted).

## What this repo is (and is not)
✅ A theoretical, regime-based formalization and language for reframing the debate  
✅ Markdown-only: definitions, minimal models, invariance proposals, testable predictions (conceptual)  
❌ Not medical/financial advice (N/A), not engineering instructions, not executable criteria  
❌ No optimization targets, thresholds, or operational decision rules  
❌ No claim of new physical constants; requires empirical validation and peer review
