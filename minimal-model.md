# Minimal Congruity Model (Conceptual)

We define a minimal conceptual coherence score:

C := V / (E + I + S)

where:

- **E** — Energy / dynamics  
  (orbital velocities, gravitational potentials, accelerations, kinetic constraints)

- **I** — Information closure  
  (observational tracers, sampling, inference completeness)

- **S** — Structure and scale  
  (geometry, hierarchical coupling, scale transitions)

- **V** — Functional value  
  (predictive stability, cross-regime consistency)

## Interpretation

Dark Matter and MOND-like theories should not be interpreted as mutually exclusive solutions,  
but as **local maxima of coherence under different regime constraints**.

The apparent dilemma emerges when a **single global inferential regime** is assumed across all scales.

Within a regime-based framing, compensatory terms arise naturally when  
E/S demands exceed the level of closure supported by I.
